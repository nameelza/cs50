sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: it was almost the same as the selection code, but the more lines of number the text doc had, the faster it went in comparison with selection sort.
It also took the least time with already sorted doc because it goes through numbers only one time.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: it took the least time with not sorted large lines of values

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: it finished faster with a sorted list and with smaller numbers of values, but took the most time with larger files
