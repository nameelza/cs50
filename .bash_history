If the user doesn’t, in fact, input a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive, when prompted, the program should re-prompt the user until they cooperate:
$ ./mario
Height: -1
Height: 0
Height: 42
Height: 50
Height: 4
####  ####
Notice that width of the “gap” between adjacent pyramids is equal to the width of two hashes, irrespective of the pyramids’ heights.
Create a new directory (i.e., folder) called mario inside of your pset1 directory, by executing
~/ $ mkdir ~/pset1/mario~/ $ mkdir ~/pset1/mario
~/ $ mkdir ~/pset1/mario
